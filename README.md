# My-Pet-Rock
A text-based game where you care for a randomly generated pet rock. They don't do much

#Info:
This is a C-Program that's built to run in a Windows environment. The rock is procedurally generated and from there you only get a few generic actions. The main goal was to make a random rock generator that makes fun but mostly realistic looking rocks
